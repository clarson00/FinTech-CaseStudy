* The CEO of Trustswap, JHeff Kirdekis describes how Trustswap got its start on pg 4 of the [whitepaper](https://pdfhost.io/v/7kEISzHai_Trust_Swap_WP_1_1pdf.pdf).

 _“A Venture Capital firm wanted to invest $50,000 in exchange for project tokens at a discount. Our company wanted to make sure that once the tokens were sent, they wouldn’t sell them all at once and crash the token price. The only way to ensure this was to hire a lawyer to act as a middleman, who would send fractional amounts of the tokens to the VC firm over time for a 5-10% fee. Absolute insanity. I figured there had to be something already created that implemented this service in a smart-contract, for a fraction of the cost. There wasn’t. Infact,     there was nothing that allowed for time-based payments at all. No trustless  escrow  for  institutions,  no  trustless  team-token  lockups,  no  automated employee payments... nothing. That realization happened on June 19th 2020. Here we are today. Welcome to TrustSwap.” - Jeff Kirdeikis, CEOTo automate and simplify the transaction process between people and/or organizations around the world through the use of well-built decentralized finance applications, eliminating the need for middlemen and 3rd party intermediaries."_
