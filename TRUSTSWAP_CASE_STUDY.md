# TRUSTSWAP Case Study

## Overview

* **Company Name:** 12170639 Canada Inc. DBA. TrustSwap (TS)
* **Incorporation:** TrustSwap is an LLC Founded in 2020
* **Founders:** Jeff Kirdekis - Founding Director & CEO, Adam Barlam - Founding Director and CTO, Joaquim Miro - Founding Director & CGO


* The CEO of Trustswap, Jeff Kirdekis describes how Trustswap got its start on pg 4 of the [TrustSwap whitepaper](https://pdfhost.io/v/7kEISzHai_Trust_Swap_WP_1_1pdf.pdf).

    _“A Venture Capital firm wanted to invest $50,000 in exchange for project tokens at a discount. Our company wanted to make sure that once the tokens were sent, they wouldn’t sell them all at once and crash the token price. The only way to ensure this was to hire a lawyer to act as a middleman, who would send fractional amounts of the tokens to the VC firm over time for a 5-10% fee. Absolute insanity. I figured there had to be something already created that implemented this service in a smart-contract, for a fraction of the cost. There wasn’t. Infact, there was nothing that allowed for time-based payments at all. No trustless  escrow  for  institutions,  no trustless team-token lockups,  no  automated employee payments... nothing. That realization happened on June 19th 2020. Here we are today. Welcome to TrustSwap.”_
    
    \- Jeff Kirdeikis, CEO
    
* **Funding:** Company is funded by token sales

\- Jeff Kirdeikis, CEO


TrustSwap is targeting both institutional and retasil crypto users. For insitutional customers, new project crypto launchnes are expensive. TrustSwap greatly reduces this costs while building in token lockups and distribution schemes that allow investors to have confidence in distribution plans and that tokens will not be dumped on the market by pre-sale, founder coin, etc. In addition to launches, all of these services are a regualr part of doing business in the finanaical world and are being brought to the Crypto space as a service by TrustSwap.

For the retail crypto users, all of these products can be used individually, outside of the TrustLaunch service.
