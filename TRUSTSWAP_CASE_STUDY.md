* The CEO of Trustswap, Jeff Kirdekis describes how Trustswap got its start on pg 4 of the [TrustSwap whitepaper](https://pdfhost.io/v/7kEISzHai_Trust_Swap_WP_1_1pdf.pdf).

    _“A Venture Capital firm wanted to invest $50,000 in exchange for project tokens at a discount. Our company wanted to make sure that once the tokens were sent, they wouldn’t sell them all at once and crash the token price. The only way to ensure this was to hire a lawyer to act as a middleman, who would send fractional amounts of the tokens to the VC firm over time for a 5-10% fee. Absolute insanity. I figured there had to be something already created that implemented this service in a smart-contract, for a fraction of the cost. There wasn’t. Infact, there was nothing that allowed for time-based payments at all. No trustless  escrow  for  institutions,  no trustless team-token lockups,  no  automated employee payments... nothing. That realization happened on June 19th 2020. Here we are today. Welcome to TrustSwap.”_
    
    \- Jeff Kirdeikis, CEO
    
    _"To automate and simplify the transaction process between people and/or organizations around the world through the use of well-built decentralized finance applications, eliminating the need for middlemen and 3rd party intermediaries."_
    
    \- Jeff Kirdeikis, CEO


* **Funding:** Company is funded by token sales

## Business ACtivities

* **TS SmartLock are Time or event based crypto lockups and payments.**
* **TS SmartSwap will allow reliable trustless escrow based transactions including OTC trades.**
* **TS SmartSubscription will allow recurring crypto payments. For examples, bill payments or allowances.**
* **TS SmartLaunch & SmartWrap Crypto launchpad.

These servies will eventually be offered outside of the SmartLaunch service**

The target customer for trustswap is any consumer be they retail or intitutional who relies on these types of services but is currently paying much higher rates and fees to attorneys, and other entities to create agreements that could be done using TrustSwap services for less costs, paperwork, and obverhead in general. It could also be argued that the smart contract means of agreement can be more reliable than traditional services.
