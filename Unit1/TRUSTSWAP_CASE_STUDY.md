# TRUSTSWAP Case Study

## Overview

**Company Name:** 12170639 Canada Inc. DBA. TrustSwap (TS)
**Incorporation:** TrustSwap is an LLC Founded in 2020
**Founders:** Jeff Kirdekis - Founding Director & CEO, Adam Barlam - Founding Director and CTO, Joaquim Miro - Founding Director & CGO


* The CEO of Trustswap, Jeff Kirdekis describes how Trustswap got its start on pg 4 of the [TrustSwap whitepaper](https://pdfhost.io/v/7kEISzHai_Trust_Swap_WP_1_1pdf.pdf).

    _“A Venture Capital firm wanted to invest $50,000 in exchange for project tokens at a discount. Our company wanted to make sure that once the tokens were sent, they wouldn’t sell them all at once and crash the token price. The only way to ensure this was to hire a lawyer to act as a middleman, who would send fractional amounts of the tokens to the VC firm over time for a 5-10% fee. Absolute insanity. I figured there had to be something already created that implemented this service in a smart-contract, for a fraction of the cost. There wasn’t. Infact, there was nothing that allowed for time-based payments at all. No trustless  escrow  for  institutions,  no trustless team-token lockups,  no  automated employee payments... nothing. That realization happened on June 19th 2020. Here we are today. Welcome to TrustSwap.”_
    
    \- Jeff Kirdeikis, CEO

TrustSwap is targeting both institutional and retail crypto users globally. For insitutional customers, TrustSwap attempts to reduce costs through its token wrapping service while building in token lockups and distribution schemes that allow investors to have confidence in distribution plans and that tokens will not be dumped on the market by pre-sale, founder coin, etc. As stated in pg 4 of the TrustSwap Whitepaper by the CEO, these traditional fees for these tpye of agreements are insane and moving them into smart contracts greatly reduces costs. In addition to new token and project launches, all of these services are a regular part of doing business in the finanaical world and are being brought to the Crypto space as a service by TrustSwap as a first mover.

For the retail crypto users, all of these products can be used individually, outside of the TrustLaunch service. 


## Landscape
The retail recurring payments industry is a multibillion dollar market and according to  ResearchAndMarkets.com U.S. Recurring Payments Market Forecast, 2017-2021, "Recurring transactions processed on debit and credit cards in the United States are expected to reach $473 billion by 2021".[^1] TrustSwap is a first mover in the Crypto markets and will be well positioned to capture both the consumer market and insitutional markets as they emerge within the cryptoverse. In addition, TrusSwap has mentioned an api service. This will allow other payment processors to easily integrate crypto recurring payments into their platforms.


## Results

TrustSwap is a startup and has only made an official release of its products recvently. To date, more than 30% of available tokes have been staked by holders. Marketing plans are or have been executed recently in Japan and China.


## Recommendations
Make an API for everything so that other developers can choose to integrate Trustswap services into thier own product and services.
